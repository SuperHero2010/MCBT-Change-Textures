# MCBT Change Textures
**THIS RESOURCE PACKS REQUIRES: MORE COMMAMD BLOCK TOOLS**

Welcome to **MCBT Change Textures**

It adds new textures to the old Command Block Tools for [More Command Block Tools](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-command-block-tools)

It will be similar to the original [Cracker's Wither Storm Mod](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crackers-wither-storm-mod)

I have a discord account
